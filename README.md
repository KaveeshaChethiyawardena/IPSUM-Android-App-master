# IPSUM-Android-App-master
Agriculture plays vital role in the development of agricultural countries. In certain developing countries in Asian continent about 50% of population depends upon farming and about one third of those nationâ€™s capital comes from farming. Issues concerning agriculture have been
always hindering the development of those countries. One main solution to this problem is smart agriculture by modernizing the current traditional methods of agriculture. Hence our project IPSUM aims at making agriculture smart using clouding and IoT technologies. We have introduced an Android mobile app based on sensor details identified through our IOT device. The highlighting features of this project includes identification of soil properties like  soil moisture of any given area, humidity,light intensity and temperature of the particular land area. Then through our app the farmer will be able to get the fertility level of the land, best crops that suits the particular land and suggestions to overcome infertility issues. Mainly via the app the farmer will be guided throughout the cultivation process with our nutrition management plan. Controlling of all these operations will be through Arduino IOT device and Android mobile app also by using cloud computing.
